# Habenero

A social game engine built in C++ with Lua scripting, designed for creating multiplayer games with a focus on social interaction and fun. The engine provides a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily create and manage game content through asset packs and Lua scripts.


## Features

- Modular C++ engine with Lua scripting
- Asset pack system for easy content management
- Scene management (main menu, loading, in-game, transitions)
- Physics and collision system
- Audio system with sound bus
- Renderer with lighting and mesh support
- Extensible via custom scripts and packages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++20 compatible compiler (MSVC, GCC, or Clang)
- Meow (if building from source)
- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (if not bundled)
- Lua 5.4 (if not bundled)

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/Fy-nite/Habenero.git

    ```
3. Run the engine:
	```sh
