# Cup


With Cup or the Custom Unified Package format, you can easily share your code and assets with other developers. Cup packages are simple zip files with a .cup extension that contain your lua code, assets, and a init.lua that describes the package and how to use it. You can create a cup package by zipping your files and renaming the extension to .cup, or by using the cup command line tool.
